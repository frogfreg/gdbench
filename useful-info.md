How can I measure disk sequential read performance using golang?

To measure disk sequential read performance using Go, youâ€™ll need to focus on reading large files in a way that avoids caching effects and accurately times the read operations. Here's a simplified approach:

1. Disable File Caching: Use a Windows-specific API to open the file with no buffering.

1. Measure Read Time: Use high-resolution timers to measure the time taken to read the file.

1. Calculate Speed: Compute the read speed based on the size of the file and the time taken.

Hereâ€™s an example code snippet to measure sequential read performance on Windows:

```go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "syscall"
    "time"
    "unsafe"
)

const (
    Megabyte = 1024 * 1024
    Gigabyte = 1024 * 1024 * 1024
)

func main() {
    filename := "your_large_test_file"

    // Open file with no buffering
    file, err := syscall.CreateFile(
        syscall.StringToUTF16Ptr(filename),
        syscall.GENERIC_READ,
        syscall.FILE_SHARE_READ,
        nil,
        syscall.OPEN_EXISTING,
        syscall.FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING|syscall.FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN,
        0,
    )
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
        return
    }
    defer syscall.CloseHandle(file)

    // Measure read speed
    samples := []float64{}
    buf := make([]byte, Megabyte)
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        start := time.Now()
        var bytesRead uint32
        for {
            err = syscall.ReadFile(file, buf, &bytesRead, nil)
            if err != nil {
                break
            }
            if bytesRead == 0 {
                break
            }
        }
        finish := time.Since(start)
        speedSample := float64(Gigabyte) / finish.Seconds() / float64(Megabyte)
        samples = append(samples, speedSample)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Read samples: %#v\n", samples)
}


```

And how do I do the same for linux ?

To measure disk sequential read performance on Linux using Go, you can follow a similar approach as with Windows, but youâ€™ll use Linux-specific system calls and techniques. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Open File with Direct I/O: Use the O_DIRECT flag to open the file with direct I/O, bypassing the cache.

1. Measure Read Time: Use high-resolution timers to measure the time taken to read the file.

1. Calculate Speed: Compute the read speed based on the size of the file and the time taken.

Hereâ€™s an example code snippet to measure sequential read performance on Linux:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "syscall"
    "time"
    "unsafe"
)

const (
    Megabyte = 1024 * 1024
    Gigabyte = 1024 * 1024 * 1024
)

func main() {
    filename := "your_large_test_file"

    // Open file with O_DIRECT flag
    file, err := syscall.Open(filename, syscall.O_RDONLY|syscall.O_DIRECT, 0)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
        return
    }
    defer syscall.Close(file)

    // Measure read speed
    samples := []float64{}
    buf := make([]byte, Megabyte)
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        start := time.Now()
        for {
            _, err := syscall.Read(file, buf)
            if err != nil {
                break
            }
        }
        finish := time.Since(start)
        speedSample := float64(Gigabyte) / finish.Seconds() / float64(Megabyte)
        samples = append(samples, speedSample)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Read samples: %#v\n", samples)
}

```

Explanation

    Disable File Caching: The syscall.Open function with O_DIRECT ensures that the file is read directly from the disk, bypassing the system cache.

    High-resolution Timer: The time.Now() and time.Since() functions provide high-resolution timing for accurate measurement.

    Read Loop: The loop reads the file in chunks and measures the total time taken.

    Speed Calculation: The read speed is calculated as the size of the file divided by the total read time.

Additional Tips

    File Size: Use a large file (several gigabytes) to reduce the impact of overhead and get a more representative measurement.

    Multiple Runs: Perform multiple reads and average the results to get a more accurate measurement.

    Block Alignment: Ensure that your buffer size is aligned with the diskâ€™s block size to avoid additional overhead.

This approach should help you measure disk sequential read performance accurately on Linux using Go. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
